She strapped on a pair of skis and quickly progressed from the bunny hill to double blacks and hasn't looked back since.

       Backstory:
       Pulses and signals are the daily lot for Electrician eBee. There's no wire, no circuit that she cannot tame. Of course, it helps when you're a creature sensitive to electromagnetic fields. Electrician eBee does her best to connect all parts of complex systems and makes it all work flawlessly. She won't hesitate to hook eBPF programs to electrical sockets if she has to. Or to report any misbehaving frequency... Wait! Could Electrician eBee be an undercover Secret Agent from the Hive?

       Backstory:
       Another mystery to solve? This is a job for Detective eBee! He has an eye for details, and always keeps it open. Ever since his honey jar was stolen as a child, he's been tracking (and catching!) offenders. There's no bug better at finding clues, be it on the crime scene or deep in flow logs. One day he'll have Badger O'Flake, his sworn enemy, locked up for good. Will he need his all-powerful eBPF tools for that? Elementary, my dear eBee!
